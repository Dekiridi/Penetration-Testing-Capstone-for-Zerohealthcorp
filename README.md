# Penetration-Testing-Capstone-for-Zerohealthcorp
A real-world simulated penetration testing engagement for **ZeroHealth Corp**, a healthcare technology company managing sensitive electronic health records (EHR). This project assesses the organization’s external and internal security posture through the complete penetration testing lifecycle, delivering actionable insights for enhancing security, ensuring HIPAA compliance, and reducing data breach risks.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To ethically simulate a cyberattack on ZeroHealth Corp’s infrastructure and document:

- Critical vulnerabilities in web applications and internal services
- Exploitation of insecure configurations and outdated services
- Post-exploitation activities and lateral movement
- Remediation strategies and business impact reporting

---

## 🏥 Industry Use Case: Healthcare Cybersecurity

The healthcare industry is a prime target for attackers due to the value of **Protected Health Information (PHI)**. With attacks on EHR systems on the rise, this project demonstrates how proactive security testing can uncover hidden threats and prevent multimillion-dollar breaches.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technology

- 💻 **Kali Linux** – Attacker’s machine  
- 🔍 **Nmap** – Network scanning  
- ⚠️ **Nikto** – Web server vulnerability assessment  
- 🕷️ **Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP** – Web application testing (XSS, SQLi)  
- 💣 **Metasploit Framework** – Exploitation toolkit  
- 📁 **Metasploitable 2** – Target system simulation  

---

## 🔄 Penetration Testing Workflow

### 1. Planning & Scoping
- Defined rules of engagement (simulation only, no harm)
- Scope: Web server, login portal, internal VM (Metasploitable2)

### 2. Reconnaissance
- Used `theHarvester` for email & subdomain discovery
- Extracted metadata from public documents
- Simulated social engineering

### 3. Scanning & Enumeration
- Nmap scan discovered 25+ open ports and exposed services
- Nikto identified outdated software and weak server configurations

### 4. Exploitation
- Gained access via critical vulnerabilities (FTP, RPC, Netcat)
- Successfully executed XSS & SQLi attacks on DVWA
- Captured proof of exploitation with screenshots

### 5. Post-Exploitation
- Extracted password hashes and patient records
- Demonstrated lateral movement
- Identified HIPAA compliance violations

### 6. Reporting & Business Recommendations
- Created executive summary and board-level presentation
- Highlighted business risks, financial impact, and solutions

## 📉 Risk Analysis

| Threat                     | Business Impact                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| PHI Exposure              | HIPAA fines, patient trust erosion              |
| Ransomware Risk           | Service shutdowns, operational delays           |
| Outdated Services         | Vulnerable to known exploits (CVE-matched)      |
| Poor Access Control       | Escalated privilege access by attackers         |

---

## ✅ Remediation Strategies

- 🔐 Enforce Least Privilege Access  
- 🔄 Patch Vulnerable Software  
- 🗑️ Remove Legacy & Dangerous Services
